# Data-and-Research-Analysis-Portfolio

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Victoria, a passionate researcher and aspiring development economist growing my skills in data analytics and impact evaluation.

My journey includes academic research, field experience, and a deep curiosity about using data to drive real-world change. I have hands-on experience with tools like **STATA** and **SPSS**, and I'm expanding my skills in **R**, **SQL**, and open-source platforms to deepen my analytical skillset.

This portfolio documents my learning and growth through real and practice-based projectsâ€”from statistical modeling to impact analysis and data visualization.
